# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Medical Claims Timeline extension has 37 failing tests across multiple test suites. These failures are primarily related to timezone handling in date parsing, sorting inconsistencies, mock configuration issues, and validation logic mismatches. This feature aims to systematically fix all failing tests while maintaining the existing functionality and ensuring robust test coverage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all date-related tests to pass consistently regardless of timezone so that the test suite is reliable across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests parse dates from JSON data THEN they SHALL normalize dates to UTC midnight to avoid timezone issues
2. WHEN tests compare expected dates THEN they SHALL use consistent date formatting that accounts for timezone normalization
3. WHEN the parser processes date strings THEN it SHALL create Date objects at local midnight (00:00:00) in the local timezone
4. WHEN tests validate date ranges THEN they SHALL account for the parser's date normalization behavior

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want claim sorting to work consistently so that timeline data is properly ordered by date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the parser generates timeline data THEN it SHALL sort claims by start date in descending order (most recent first)
2. WHEN multiple claims have the same start date THEN they SHALL be sorted by a secondary criterion (e.g., ID or end date)
3. WHEN tests validate sorting THEN they SHALL expect the correct sort order based on the actual parser implementation
4. WHEN the generateTimelineData method is called THEN it SHALL consistently apply the same sorting logic

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all mock configurations to work correctly so that tests can run in isolation without external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests use fs mocks THEN they SHALL properly mock both sync and async file operations
2. WHEN tests mock VSCode APIs THEN they SHALL provide all required methods and properties
3. WHEN tests use parser mocks THEN they SHALL return data in the expected format
4. WHEN tests run in parallel THEN mock configurations SHALL not interfere with each other

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want validation logic to be consistent between implementation and tests so that tests accurately reflect the actual behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests validate claim structures THEN they SHALL match the actual validation logic in the parsers
2. WHEN tests expect certain claims to be filtered out THEN they SHALL align with the parser's filtering behavior
3. WHEN tests validate error conditions THEN they SHALL expect the correct error types and messages
4. WHEN tests check fallback behavior THEN they SHALL match the actual fallback implementation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests to properly simulate the extension environment so that they test realistic scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL properly mock the VSCode extension context
2. WHEN tests simulate file operations THEN they SHALL use consistent mock data formats
3. WHEN tests validate extension commands THEN they SHALL properly simulate command registration and execution
4. WHEN tests check error handling THEN they SHALL simulate realistic error conditions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance tests to use realistic data and expectations so that they validate actual performance characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance tests generate large datasets THEN they SHALL use realistic claim data structures
2. WHEN tests measure sorting performance THEN they SHALL account for the actual sorting implementation
3. WHEN tests validate memory usage THEN they SHALL use appropriate thresholds for the data sizes
4. WHEN tests check edge cases THEN they SHALL use data that reflects real-world scenarios

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want error handling tests to validate the correct error types and recovery mechanisms so that error scenarios are properly tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests validate error types THEN they SHALL expect the correct error classes based on the implementation
2. WHEN tests check error messages THEN they SHALL match the actual error message formats
3. WHEN tests validate recovery suggestions THEN they SHALL match the implemented recovery logic
4. WHEN tests check error context THEN they SHALL expect the properties that are actually set by the error handlers
