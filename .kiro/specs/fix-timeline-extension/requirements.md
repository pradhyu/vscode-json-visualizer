# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Medical Claims Timeline Viewer extension has a complex architecture with multiple parsers, configuration management, and advanced error handling. While a simplified version works correctly, the full-featured extension fails to display the timeline chart. This feature aims to fix the original extension while preserving all its advanced capabilities including flexible parsing, configuration management, comprehensive error handling, and rich visualization features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the Medical Claims Timeline extension, I want the full-featured extension to work correctly so that I can benefit from all its advanced features like flexible parsing and configuration options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I right-click on a JSON file with medical claims data THEN the extension SHALL successfully parse the data using the appropriate parser (ClaimsParser or FlexibleClaimsParser)
2. WHEN the parsing is successful THEN the extension SHALL create and display a timeline visualization in a webview panel
3. WHEN the webview loads THEN it SHALL show the timeline chart with proper D3.js rendering instead of being stuck on "Loading timeline data..."
4. WHEN I hover over timeline elements THEN the extension SHALL display detailed tooltips with claim information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper error handling and debugging capabilities so that I can understand what went wrong if the extension fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension encounters an error during parsing THEN it SHALL display user-friendly error messages with actionable suggestions
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the extension SHALL provide specific information about what data structure is expected
3. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the extension SHALL log detailed information to the console for troubleshooting
4. WHEN the webview fails to load THEN the extension SHALL detect and report the specific failure point

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to maintain all its existing advanced features while fixing the core functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension loads THEN it SHALL preserve the ConfigManager for handling user settings
2. WHEN parsing data THEN it SHALL use the FlexibleClaimsParser for custom configurations and ClaimsParser for standard formats
3. WHEN creating the timeline THEN it SHALL use the TimelineRenderer with all its advanced visualization features
4. WHEN errors occur THEN it SHALL use the comprehensive ErrorHandler with recovery suggestions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to work with the existing test data format so that I can verify the fix is working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the test-claims.json file THEN the extension SHALL successfully parse the rxTba array
2. WHEN the data is parsed THEN it SHALL create timeline entries for each medication with proper start and end dates
3. WHEN the timeline renders THEN it SHALL display medication names, dosages, and supply duration information
4. WHEN I interact with the timeline THEN it SHALL provide the same rich interaction features as the simple version

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see all claim types (rxTba, rxHistory, medHistory) displayed on the timeline with interactive controls so that I can analyze different types of medical data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the timeline loads THEN it SHALL display all available claim types (rxTba, rxHistory, medHistory) with distinct visual styling
2. WHEN multiple claim types are present THEN each type SHALL have a unique color and visual representation
3. WHEN the timeline renders THEN it SHALL include an interactive legend showing all claim types with their colors
4. WHEN I click on a legend item THEN the extension SHALL toggle the visibility of that claim type on the timeline
5. WHEN I toggle claim types THEN the timeline SHALL smoothly animate the changes and maintain proper scaling
6. WHEN all claim types of one category are hidden THEN the legend item SHALL show a visual indication (e.g., grayed out or crossed out)
7. WHEN I hover over legend items THEN it SHALL show additional information about that claim type (e.g., count of claims)
