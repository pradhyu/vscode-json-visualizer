# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The medical claims timeline currently has zoom and pan functionality that is technically working (transforms are being applied and logged correctly), but the visual feedback is not working properly. Users can see the transform values changing in the debug log, but the timeline elements don't move or scale visually as expected. This creates a poor user experience where zoom and pan controls appear broken even though the underlying mechanics are functioning.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing the medical claims timeline, I want smooth and responsive zoom functionality so that I can examine claims at different levels of detail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I scroll the mouse wheel over the timeline THEN the timeline SHALL zoom in or out smoothly around the mouse cursor position
2. WHEN I click the zoom in (+) button THEN the timeline SHALL zoom in by a consistent factor with smooth animation
3. WHEN I click the zoom out (-) button THEN the timeline SHALL zoom out by a consistent factor with smooth animation
4. WHEN I zoom in or out THEN the claim bars SHALL scale appropriately and remain positioned correctly
5. WHEN I zoom THEN the x-axis labels SHALL update to show appropriate time granularity for the current zoom level

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing the medical claims timeline, I want smooth and responsive pan functionality so that I can navigate to different time periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click and drag on the timeline THEN the timeline SHALL pan smoothly in the direction of the drag
2. WHEN I use the pan control buttons (↑, ↓, ←, →) THEN the timeline SHALL pan in the corresponding direction
3. WHEN I pan THEN all timeline elements (claim bars, axes, labels) SHALL move together as a cohesive unit
4. WHEN I pan THEN the movement SHALL be constrained to reasonable bounds to prevent panning too far off the data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user viewing the medical claims timeline, I want the zoom and pan controls to provide clear visual feedback so that I understand the current state and can navigate effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I zoom THEN the zoom level indicator SHALL update to show the current zoom percentage
2. WHEN I reach zoom limits THEN the zoom buttons SHALL be disabled appropriately
3. WHEN I use keyboard shortcuts (+, -, 0, F) THEN they SHALL trigger the same zoom actions as the buttons
4. WHEN I click "Zoom to Fit" THEN the timeline SHALL zoom and pan to show all claims optimally
5. WHEN I click "Reset View" THEN the timeline SHALL return to the default zoom and pan state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user viewing the medical claims timeline, I want the zoom and pan functionality to work consistently across all view modes so that I have a consistent experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I switch between Timeline, Table, and Both views THEN zoom and pan functionality SHALL remain available in timeline portions
2. WHEN I zoom or pan in one view mode THEN switching to another view mode SHALL preserve the zoom/pan state
3. WHEN I use Both view mode THEN zoom and pan SHALL only affect the timeline portion, not the table portion
