### Dependencies

**Runtime Dependencies**
- moment: ^2.29.4 (Date parsing and formatting)

**Development Dependencies**
- @types/vscode: ^1.74.0 (VSCode API types)
- @types/node: ^18.0.0 (Node.js types)
- typescript: ^4.9.4 (TypeScript compiler)
- vitest: ^1.0.0 (Testing framework)
- @vitest/ui: ^1.0.0 (Test UI)

### System Requirements

**VSCode Version**
- Minimum: VSCode 1.74.0
- Recommended: Latest stable version

**Operating Systems**
- Windows 10/11
- macOS 10.15+
- Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+, other distributions)

**Hardware Requirements**
- RAM: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended for large datasets
- Storage: 50MB for extension, additional space for data files
- CPU: Modern multi-core processor recommended for large files

### Known Issues

**Performance**
- Files with 10,000+ claims may take several seconds to process
- Very large files (50MB+) may cause memory pressure
- Timeline rendering may be slow on older hardware

**Compatibility**
- Some date formats may not parse correctly in all locales
- Custom JSON structures may require configuration
- WebView rendering may vary across different VSCode themes

**Limitations**
- Maximum recommended file size: 100MB
- Maximum recommended claims per file: 50,000
- Limited to JSON file format only
- Requires valid JSON structure

### Workarounds

**Large File Handling**
- Split large files by date range for better performance
- Remove unnecessary fields to reduce file size
- Use pagination settings for files with many claims
- Close other applications to free memory

**Date Format Issues**
- Use ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) for best compatibility
- Configure custom date format in settings if needed
- Validate date formats before loading files
- Check for timezone-related date parsing issues

### Security Considerations

**Data Privacy**
- Extension processes data locally in VSCode
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- Webview content is sandboxed for security
- Always anonymize real patient data before use

**File Handling**
- Extension only reads files explicitly opened by user
- No automatic file scanning or indexing
- Temporary data is cleared when extension closes
- No persistent storage of sensitive data

### Future Roadmap

**Planned Features**
- Export functionality (CSV, PDF, images)
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Multiple timeline views and layouts
- Integration with other healthcare data formats
- Real-time data updates and streaming
- Collaborative features for team analysis

**Performance Improvements**
- WebWorker support for background processing
- Virtual scrolling for very large datasets
- Incremental loading and caching
- Memory usage optimizations

**User Experience Enhancements**
- Improved keyboard navigation
- Accessibility improvements
- Mobile-responsive timeline view
- Customizable timeline layouts
- Advanced tooltip customization
